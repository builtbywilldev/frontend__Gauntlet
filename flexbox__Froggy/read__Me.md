# 🐸 Flexbox Froggy — Challenge Complete

This folder contains screenshots from all 24 levels of the Flexbox Froggy game.

Each level was solved manually as part of the Frontend Gauntlet — focused on layout fundamentals, flex-direction, alignment, and spacing.

---

## 📂 Structure

- Screens are labeled using BEM-style naming (`flexbox__froggy--level-1`, etc.)
- Includes a `flexbox__froggy--final-boss` and `flexbox__froggy--completed` badge
- Full vertical capture for each level (scrollview format)

---

## ✅ Purpose

This isn't a flexbox demo — it's a log of layout reps.  
Every screenshot is a receipt.
