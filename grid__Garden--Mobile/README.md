# 🥬 Zen Garden — CSS Grid Challenge Log

This folder contains screenshots from all 28 levels of the **CSS Grid Garden** game.

Each level was solved manually during mobile/lunch sessions as part of the **Frontend Gauntlet** — focused on grid-template mastery, track sizing, alignment, and flow.

---

## 🗂️ Structure

- Screens are labeled using BEM-style naming (`garden__Level--1`, etc.)
- Includes a `garden__Final--Boss` and `garden__Complete` image
- Full vertical capture for each level (scrollview format)
- Solutions stored in `SOLUTIONS.md`

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This isn’t a CSS showcase —  
It’s a **receipt log**.  
A timestamp of reps that will evolve with time.

Some solutions are mine.  
Some are borrowed.  
All of them are learned.

## 🔖 Notes

- `--Mobile` suffix means this game was completed on mobile or during lunch breaks
- More games to come as I complete the full Gauntlet
