# ðŸ¥— flukeout__CSSâ€”Diner

**Selector mastery, one bite at a time.**  
This repo documents my journey through all 32 levels of [Flukeout](https://flukeout.github.io/) â€” the legendary CSS Diner challenge.

From `div` soup to `nth-child()` gourmet, this is where my selector skills got sharpened.

## ðŸ§  Why I'm Doing This

I donâ€™t just want to *write* CSS.  
I want to **command** the DOM like a kitchen general.  
Flukeout trains the mind to:
- Spot structural patterns
- Nail selector specificity
- Think in clean, logical CSS flows
