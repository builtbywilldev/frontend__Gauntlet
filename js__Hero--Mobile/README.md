# 🧠 JavaScript Hero – Level Tracker

JavaScript is the operating system of frontend.  
This repo logs my real-time skill reps through 50+ logic challenges.

---

## 🧩 Current Progress
- ✅ Level 1–25: Logic, strings, arrays, conditionals
- ⏳ Level 26+: Loop mastery, object challenges, real-world patterns

## 📍 Why I'm Doing This
- I’m not chasing trick questions — I’m grinding core fluency.
- Every level solved = one more tool sharpened.
- My frontend dev path is built on truth, not fluff.
