# 🧠 Frontend Gauntlet

This isn’t a portfolio — it’s a record of reps.

Each folder is a coding challenge I completed — layout games, UI drills, logic tests.  
No fluff, no frameworks — just raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Named with BEM. Tracked with Git. Built to last.

## 🎯 Goal

Practice with intent.  
Ship every time.

Each commit = a rep that made me better
