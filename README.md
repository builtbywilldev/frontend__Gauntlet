# 🧠 Frontend Gauntlet

This isn’t a portfolio — it’s a record of reps.

Each folder is a coding challenge I completed — layout games, UI drills, logic tests.  
No fluff, no frameworks — just raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Named with BEM. Tracked with Git. Built to last.

## 🎯 Goal

Build muscle memory.  
Practice with intent.  
Ship every time.

---

## 📂 Structure

Each folder = one challenge  
Each screenshot = proof of completion  
Each commit = a rep that made me better

---

## 🛠️ Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)

### 📱 Folder Suffix Key

// --Mobile → challenge logs completed away from desktop
//           typically puzzle-style games (Flexbox Froggy, etc)
//           done on breaks, phones, or casual sessions

// No suffix → logic-based desktop projects or applied UI challenges
//           built with full tooling, more in-depth or structured
